Quick Tips
Click to view

To display the animated loader, we need to import the Loader component using the below statement

In order to display the given animated loader, pass the type and color props to the Loader component with values as Oval and #ffffff , respectively

Important Note
Click to view

The following instructions are required for the tests to pass

The banner image in the Team Matches Route should have the alt attribute value as team banner
The alt attribute values for the images received from the response are given in the Example response
The API responses received from the given api URLs should be converted to camel case
Wrap the Loader component with an HTML container element and add the testid attribute value as loader to it as shown below <div testid="loader"> <Loader type="Oval" color="#ffffff" height={50} width={50} /> </div>
Render HomeRoute component when path in URL matches /
Render TeamMatchesRoute component when path in URL matches /team-matches/:id
No need to use the BrowserRouter in App.js as we have already included in index.js file
Each TeamMatchesRoute should have different gradient colors as background based on the selected team

Things to Keep in Mind
All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.
Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
Do not remove the pre-filled code
